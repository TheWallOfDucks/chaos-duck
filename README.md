### How it works

Chaos Duck will randomly choose from the services you provide and perform a single chaotic action to the chosen service. To cause more chaos, simply invoke Chaos Duck again. If no services are explicitly specified in the POST body, all supported services will be considered fair game.

### Supported services

These are the curent supported AWS services to wreak havoc on. Choose wisely.

- EC2: Chaos Duck will randomly stop your EC2 instances
- ECS: Chaos Duck will randomly stop your ECS tasks
- ElastiCache: Chaos Duck will randomly failover your ElastiCache instance

### Quick start

Before getting started make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) installed. Once you have set that up, make sure you have the following information from your AWS account: account number and role to assume to deploy lambda

1. Clone the project and install all dependencies

        npm install

2. Create a symlink to enable the `chaos-duck` command globally

        npm link

3. Deploy to your account using [duck.json](#markdown-header-using-duck.json) or [CLI options](#markdown-header-using-cli-options)

    CLI Options:

        chaos-duck deploy -e <environment> -a <account> -r <role>

    If using a `duck.json` configuration file:

        chaos-duck deploy -c duck.json

4. Once deployed, a `duck.json` config file will be created (or modified) for you in your current directory

    ```json
    {
        "chaosUrl": "https://abcdef123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/chaos",
        "environment": "sandbox",
        "account": "12345678912",
        "role": "Sandbox-Developer",
        "profile": "default",
        "stage": "dev"
    }
    ```

5. To begin wreaking chaos, simply invoke it

        chaos-duck invoke -c duck.json

6. To undeploy

        chaos-duck undeploy -c duck.json

### Using duck.json

You can also `deploy` or `invoke` by providing the path to a `duck.json` config file

```sh
# Using the duck.json in your current working directory
chaos-duck deploy -c duck.json
```

Supported properties

- `environment`: Environment name. Can be any string used by you to identify an environment
- `account`: AWS account number
- `role`: AWS role to assume during deploy. Whatever profile you specify needs to have access to assume this role
- `profile`: Profile in your AWS .credentials file to use. Defaults to "default"
- `stage`: Deployment stage in AWS. Defaults to "dev"
- `services`: Comma separated service values to invoke chaos on. Defaults to all services
    - These values are not case sensitive
- `slackWebhookUrl`: Slack webhook url to post notifications to
- `chaosUrl`: The url to call when invoking Chaos Duck
    - This value will be ignored during deployments

### Using CLI Options

`chaos-duck --help`

```sh
Usage: chaos-duck [options] [command]

Options:
  -v, --version         output the version number

Commands:
  deploy|d [options]    Deploy Chaos Duck
  invoke|i [options]    Unleash Chaos Duck
  undeploy|u [options]  Undeploy Chaos Duck
```

### Using HTTP POST

```js

{
    "services": ["ECS", "ElastiCache"]
}
```
